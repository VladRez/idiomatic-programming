# JavaScript 
JavaScript (JS) doesn't run on an operating system in the same way C/C++, Java or C# would. 
Instead JavaScript is completely interpreted within an application like a web browser. 
And for all intents and purposes JavaScript is created for and specializes in manipulating web pages. However, because JavaScripts is a simple and flexible language it has evolved to be used within other application to create and automate tasks. 

A JavaScript implementation is made up of three core parts:
* ECMAScript - language standardization and specification
* Document Object Model - API for mapping out HTML and XML pages as nodes. 
* Browser Object Model - Allows access and manipulation browser window

<!--
# ECMAScript

The European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) over a decade ago standardized and created specification for JavaScript known today as EMCAScript.

The document describes in detail part of the language:
* Keywords
* Reserved words
* Syntax
* Statements
* Operators
* etc..

# Document Object Model (DOM)

The Document Object Molde is an API for mapping out HTML and XML pages as nodes. 

# Browser Object Model

The Browser Object Model allows access browser window.
