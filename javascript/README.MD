# JavaScript 
JavaScript (JS) doesn't run on an operating system in the same way C/C++, Java or C# would. 
Instead Js is completely interpreted within an application like a web browser using a JavaScript engine. 
For all intents and purposes Js is created for and specializes in manipulating web pages. However, because Js
is a simple yet powerful language it can also be used within other application to automate tasks. For example, 
Adobe Acrobate the most widely used PDF reader allows users to use Js dynamically create and manage PDF documents.
