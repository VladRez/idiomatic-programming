# JavaScript 
JavaScript (JS) doesn't run on an operating system in the same way C/C++, Java or C# would. 
Instead Js is completely interpreted within an application like a web browser. 
And for all intents and purposes Js is created for and specializes in manipulating web pages. However, because Js
is a simple and flexible language it can also be used within other application. 
Adobe CC Suite allows users to write Js scripts for task automation and dynamic content creation.
